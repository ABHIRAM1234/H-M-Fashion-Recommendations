This repo contains our final solution. Big shout out to my wonderful teammates! [@zhouyuanzhe](https://github.com/zhouyuanzhe) [@tarickMorty](https://github.com/tarickMorty) [@Thomasyyj](https://github.com/Thomasyyj) [@ChenmienTan](https://github.com/ChenmienTan)

Our team ranked 45/3006 in the end with a LB score of 0.0292 and a PB score of 0.02996.

Our final solution contains 2 recall strategies and we trained 3 different ranking models (LGB ranker, LGB classifier, DNN) for each strategy.

Candidates from the two strategies are quite different so that ensembling the ranking results can help to improve the score. From our experiments, LB score of a single recall strategy can only reach 0.0286 and ensembling helps us to boost up to 0.0292. We also believe that ensembling can make our predicting result more robust.

Due to hardware limits (50G of RAM), we only generated avg 50 candidates for each user and used 4 weeks of data to train the models.
